Project Name: Amazon Clone
Developed a responsive front-end clone of the Amazon homepage using HTML and CSS. The project replicates key UI components including the navigation bar, product listings, banners, and footer. It demonstrates strong understanding of layout design, Flexbox, and CSS styling. This project enhanced my skills in structuring web pages and building visually appealing, user-friendly interfaces.
